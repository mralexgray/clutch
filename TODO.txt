TODO
==================================================
- *if* the memory issue is sorted, maybe try getting torrent info in groups of 3/4/whatever is safe to try and speed things up a bit?
- Clean up BigBlueHouse class once the structure gets a bit clearer- currently semi-duplicating GetTorrents(=getTorrentData) & MergeArraysById(=mergeTorrentData) functions for convenience + don't want to get rid of anything without confirming - must be a nicer way to do this getData/merge stuff but it's not obvious how to do it.
- Some display should happen while the torrent is processing 'resume' - stopping says 'Stopping...', should resume say 'checking existing files' or something? 
- Sqlite db for prefs - refresh frequency, user login details, filter etc etc.
- Implement filter buttons.
	- Filtering doesn't seem to be working properly after a filtered pause/resume all - only a couple of torrents show up as paused.
	- Need to update the filter if torrents are paused - they should disappear from the list if 'seeding' or 'downloading' is selected
- There's a rogue </li> at the start of the torrent list - maybe what's causing the safari <ul> top-position problem?
- Right-click menu doesn't work in opera.
- 'Remove from list' right-menu option remains highlighted after confirm screen in Safari.
- Keep track of 'active' torrents in jscript controller for the torrent remove dialogue box.
- Implement search box.
- Torrent sorting (need to pass to filters too i guess).
- Torrent uploading.
- Add a loading indicator? Ajax requests could be quite bit long with  lot of torrents - need some indication that something is happening.
- A lot of work to do on the context menu
	- Hook up the links
	- enable/disable menu options dynamically instead of all enable

OPTIMIZATIONS
==================================================
- Inspector
	- Make the whole inspector wider? Hash currently clipped
	- css cursor:pointer doesn't work on safari after a tab has been clicked for some reason.
- Scrollbar in firefox screws with the confirm dialog a little with small-width displays.
- Caching system? Don't refresh un-changing values, such as a torrents total size, or files (semi-done, need to handle unchanging values specifically in torrent.js->refresh() - keep in mind for future optimization).
- Don't update paused torrents (unless we integrate the socket stuff into libT, Then maybe update paused torrents every couple updates or such? [probably shouldn't bother]) - (nice idea gimp, hadn't thought of it)

CHECK
==================================================
- Do we need to put the PEX info in the inspector?
- Do we need to worry about the various 'remove files' options in the right-click menu? Also, I've removed the file location stuff from the inspector for now - do we need it?
- Where does 'Valid DL' come from for the inspector?
- What does 'Resume selected without wait' do?
- Do we need to worry about translations? I assume we do (the confirm dialog jscript messages might be a little fiddly to translate). Maybe we can initialise some translation constants in the JS files with ajax or something :S
- Is there a set 'remaining time unknown' time in transmission? currently set to 999 hours with jscript.
- Had a torrent wth ratio '.1' instead of '0.1' (although another one with '0.08' was working ok) - prob with the ratio formatting?
- Have to pass all the torrent IDs for ajax stuff now that filtering is implemented - stress test with a 100 or so torrents sometime to check that the GET string is not too long. May need to ajax POST.

IN THE FUTURE (?)
==================================================
- IE support if possible.
- Fix up <UL> scrolling - seems to be a little wacky on different browsers. Ideally only have a scrollbar for the <ul> - (gimp's stuff is working great so far for the browsers we care about. Would be nice to have the list floating to the top so we can animate the filter bar open/close but no-one anywhere seems to have figured a top-floating 3-row layout yet - keep an eye out for new techniques but not a big deal).
- Inspector layout should be aligned better (would a table be best here? it *is* a table of values...) - Tried table layout but couldn't get all the widths to line up properly, plus couldn't get overflow ellipsis to work properly - label/div for now but maybe tables later


DONE
==================================================
- Web interface loads too quickly when ./run-bin.command is run - requests torrent list before torrents are loaded - (thanks swe, works great - dave)
- Total up/down should show 'x.0' instead of just 'x' if it's an integer to match the desktop app.
- Implement torrent inspector.
- when multiple torrents are selected, deselecting one destroys the inspector, multiple torrents should instead show "multiple torrents selected", and the total filesize of the torrents
- A lot of the values can be stripped out (unnecessary stuff)
- Get a weird '-1 hours remaining' thing *very* occasionally - try to figure out why (dave)
- Torrent error messages aren't displaying (eg 'torrent not registered with this tracker') - just get 'Paused'.
- why does the following line of torrent.js erroring if uncommented? (SyntaxError - Parse Error)
	if (data.private)	this._private		= data.private;
- Major issues!!! <-- READ
	- BEncode classes run out of memory with large numbers of torrents (5+) :
	  Pretty sure this is a memory prob, getting :
	  	"httpd(14838) malloc: ***  Deallocation of a pointer not malloced: 0x3482f0; 
		This could be a double free(), or free() called with the middle of an allocated block; 
		Try setting environment variable MallocHelp to see tools to help debug"
	  possibly garbage collection clearing stuff we're using because everything is taking so long (random guess)?
	- We need it to not ask for all data at once, but instead first get info all and *just* grab the torrent ids, then from there, make a request for each id's data. Asking for all at once either gives problems with the socket, or php runs out of memory.
- Arrow-Key still doesnt't work 100% - click an element near the bottom and then apple-click the first torrent in the list and press up. Same for the down key.
- Right-Click - constrain the menu so it doesn't go outside the borders of the screen or under the scrollbar
- Right-Click - Figure out which torrent is underneath the click position (Unnecessary)
- Right-Click - Allow click event through to the torrent so it behaves correctly when you right-click on unselected torrents
- 'Pause Selected' and 'Resume Selected' affect every torrent if nothing is selected.
- Inspector needs tabs (Info - Activity - Files)
- Only grab new information (speeds / peers)
- OnClick image change for all buttons (surrently don't have the graphics).
- The per-torrent reveal-in-finder button doesn't make much sense in a browser - should this be dropped or changed to something else (maybe a torrent details button?). Would be good to try & keep the interface buttons consistent between the desktop & web if at all possible. (Just the pause/resume button for now)
- How are the downloading from/to and seeding to numbers calculated? (peers_from, peers_downloading, peers_uploading, peers_total) Is the way it's being displayed at the moment correct? (Looks OK)
- Last change seems to have broken Safari - figure out why (gimp - float is a reserved word)
- Multi-GB torrents can have greater than 2147483647 bytes, making them hit 100% early (gimp - changed from int to float).
- Figure out a way to convert an array into something that can be accepted by func_get_args(), as this is used all over the place. Passing an array seems to result in just one argument (the array) instead of lots (the strings in the array). Tried using a combo of eval & implode but doesn't seem to work. (gimp - fixed messageclass to accept an array argument instead of list)
- Pausing torrents works ok but resuming seems to timeout, comes back eventually with the message 'This program has encountered an error and will now exit.'. The torrent gets restarted almost straight away so it's working at some level. (gimp - made messageclass not listen for response)
