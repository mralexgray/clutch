TODO
==================================================
- How are the downloading from/to and seeding to numbers calculated? (peers_from, peers_downloading, peers_uploading, peers_total)
- Fix up <UL> scrolling - seems to be a little wacky on different browsers.
- Last change seems to have broken Safari - figure out why.
- Multi-GB torrents can have greater than 2147483647 bytes, making them hit 100% early.

DONE
==================================================
